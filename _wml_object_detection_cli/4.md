title: Creating object storage credentials
date: 1970-01-4

We already have an object storage instance, but now we need a way to access our data from outside of IBM Cloud.
To be able to do this we need to create a set credentials for our resource.

We can do this by navigating to the **Service credentials** tab and clicking the **New credential** button.

You can leave most of the options blank, but make sure the credential has the role of **Writer** and add the following inline configuration parameters:
```
{"HMAC": true}
```

Once added, click the **View credentials â–¾** dropdown and take note of your **access_key_id** and **secret_access_key**.
